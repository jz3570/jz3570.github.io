#### Introduction: 
##### I am currently a first-year master's student in biostatistics major at Columbia University. I graduated with my Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Math with a concentration in statistics from Bucknell University.

##### I have always been quite skilled in extracting and analyzing data. I have taken several classes related to data analysis, such as Statistics I & II, Probability, Statistical Inference, Data Science and Biostatistical Method. At the same time, I can use Python, Minitab, and R language to analyze data more efficiently and effectively. I have done many projects related to biostatistics and data analysis. For my senior project, I investigated how substance use disorder is handled in recovery friendly businesses, where I design the randomized sampling process (stratified), calculate the sample size needed and the appropriate allocation in each stratum, created the survey questionnaire and wrote IRB proposal.
